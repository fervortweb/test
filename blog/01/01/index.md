So TCL is installed on your windows.  Now we will set path of C:\\Tcl\\bin\\ directory so, we can run it from any location.

To set path just copy the path up to bin directory ( In my case it is C:Tcl\\bin\\ ) and fire command like this

Path is set so we can run TCL from any location. Lets try to run it from D drive. First create one small TCL and save it on D drive with name Hello.tcl . So the path is D:\\Hello.tcl
